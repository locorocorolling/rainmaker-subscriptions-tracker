# Subscription Management Tool - TODO List

## Current Status
**Phase**: Post-Frontend Scaffolding, Pre-Integration (Backend scaffolding complete)
**Time Constraint**: 16-20 hours total for interview project
**Priority Order**: Frontend polish > API completeness > System design > Tests

## Branch Status
- **Current Branch**: `feature-backend-scaffolding`
- **Latest Work**: Backend scaffolding, Docker Compose setup, Mongoose schemas complete
- **Documentation**: Reorganized into working-docs/ structure for parallel development

## âœ… Recently Completed
- [x] Frontend scaffolding (React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)
- [x] Backend scaffolding (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)
- [x] Shared TypeScript types (subscription, common, analytics)
- [x] Date calculation utilities with edge case handling
- [x] MongoDB schemas with Mongoose
- [x] Docker Compose setup (Redis + MongoDB)
- [x] Documentation reorganization

## Immediate Actions
- [ ] Create WHATS_NEXT.md for integration planning
- [ ] Set up frontend-backend integration workflow
- [ ] Start implementing core subscription CRUD operations

## Phase 1: Frontend-Backend Integration (Priority: HIGH)
### Core Integration Tasks
- [ ] Connect frontend components to real API endpoints
- [ ] Replace mock data with actual API calls
- [ ] Implement authentication flow (JWT-based)
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Set up proper environment configuration

### API Development
- [ ] Complete CRUD endpoints for subscriptions
- [ ] Implement analytics endpoints
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
- [ ] Set up error handling standardization
- [ ] Create OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Database Integration
- [ ] Test MongoDB schemas with real data
- [ ] Add proper indexing for performance
- [ ] Implement data migration strategy
- [ ] Set up database seeding for development

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (Priority: MEDIUM)
### Enhanced Features
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV/PDF)
- [ ] Notification system with BullMQ
- [ ] Analytics dashboard with charts
- [ ] Subscription categories and tagging

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Production deployment setup
- [ ] Environment configuration management
- [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Phase 3: Polish & Documentation (Priority: LOW)
### Documentation Deliverables
- [ ] Complete README with setup instructions
- [ ] API documentation with examples
- [ ] Technical decision document (1-2 pages)
- [ ] Demo script preparation (5-10 min video)

### Final Polish
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening

## Session Handover Notes
### Completed in Current Session
- [x] Backend scaffolding completion
- [x] Docker Compose setup
- [x] Documentation reorganization
- [x] Consolidated planning approach

### Pending for Next Session
- [ ] Start frontend-backend integration
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Create integration testing framework
- [ ] Begin API documentation

### Important Context
- All scaffolding is complete, ready for integration
- Time is constrained to 16-20 hours total
- Focus on demo-ready features over completeness
- Documentation organized for parallel development
