# Demo Script Notes

## Edge Case Date Handling (Technical Highlight)
**Demo Talking Point**: "Industry-standard billing date calculations following Stripe's approach"
**Show**: 
- Create subscription on Jan 31st with monthly billing
- Demonstrate how it correctly renews Feb 28th (or 29th in leap year), then Mar 31st
- Mention this follows the same logic as Stripe and other major payment processors
**Technical Depth**: 
- Custom date calculation algorithms
- Leap year handling
- Strategy pattern for different business rules
**Why It Impresses**: Shows attention to production-ready edge cases most developers overlook

## Type Safety Implementation
**Demo Talking Point**: "Comprehensive TypeScript types prevent runtime errors"
**Show**: Shared types between frontend/backend, validation constants, type guards
**Code Location**: `shared/types/subscription.ts`
**Technical Depth**: Money stored in minor units, denormalized analytics fields
**Why It Impresses**: Shows scalable architecture thinking and data consistency planning

## Authentication System (Security Showcase)
**Demo Talking Point**: "JWT-based authentication with proper security practices"
**Show**:
- User registration with password hashing
- Login flow with JWT token generation
- Protected endpoints with authentication middleware
- User profile retrieval with valid tokens
**Technical Depth**:
- bcryptjs password hashing with 12 salt rounds
- JWT tokens with 7-day expiration
- Express middleware for route protection
- Joi input validation for security
**Code Location**: `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`, `backend/src/routes/auth.ts`
**Why It Impresses**: Demonstrates understanding of security best practices and clean code organization

## Docker Infrastructure Setup
**Demo Talking Point**: "Production-ready infrastructure with Docker Compose"
**Show**:
- MongoDB, Redis, and monitoring services running in containers
- Health check endpoints showing database connectivity
- Service discovery and networking
**Technical Depth**:
- Docker Compose configuration
- Database connection management
- Graceful startup procedures
**Why It Impresses**: Shows DevOps knowledge and production deployment preparation

## Modern Frontend Architecture
**Demo Talking Point**: "Professional React frontend with enterprise-grade components"
**Show**:
- Responsive subscription management dashboard
- Interactive data table with sorting and filtering
- Modal-based CRUD operations with form validation
- Real-time subscription summaries and analytics
**Technical Features**:
- TanStack Table for advanced data grid (accessible, sortable, filterable)
- React Hook Form + Zod for type-safe form validation
- Radix UI primitives for accessible component library
- Professional status badges and filtering system
- Currency formatting and date calculations
**Why It Impresses**: Shows modern frontend development practices and attention to UX

## Visual Polish Evidence
**Screenshots**: [`docs/screenshots/`](../../docs/screenshots/) - Subscription management, data tables, error states, empty states
**Demo Talking Point**: "Debug controls let you see all UI states instantly - no backend manipulation needed"
**Why It Impresses**: Shows both technical implementation and demo preparation
