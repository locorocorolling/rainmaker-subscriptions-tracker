# Deployment Options

## Quick Demo Deployment: Railway

**Best for**: Sharing demo links quickly, weekend project presentations

### Setup
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway up  # Auto-detects docker-compose.yml
```

### Benefits
- **One-command deployment**: Handles MongoDB + Redis + apps automatically
- **Custom JWT compatible**: No auth service conflicts
- **Free tier**: Perfect for demos and portfolio projects  
- **Custom domains**: Get shareable links immediately
- **Docker native**: Uses your existing docker-compose.yml

### Configuration
- Remove `mongo-express` and `redis-commander` services for production
- Environment variables managed through Railway dashboard
- Auto-HTTPS and custom domains included

---

## Production Deployment: Coolify

**Best for**: Long-term hosting, full control, cost-effective scaling

### Setup
```bash
# On your VPS (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

### Benefits
- **Self-hosted**: Full control over infrastructure
- **Docker-first**: One-click deployments from Git repos
- **Cost effective**: $5/month VPS vs per-service pricing
- **Production ready**: Built-in monitoring, backups, SSL
- **Stack agnostic**: Supports your exact MongoDB + Redis + custom JWT setup

### Configuration
- Connect your Git repository
- Coolify auto-detects docker-compose.yml
- Set up automated deployments on push
- Configure domain + SSL certificates

## Service Modifications for Production

### Remove Development Tools
```yaml
# Comment out or remove these services in production:
# mongo-express:     # Database web UI (dev only)
# redis-commander:   # Redis web UI (dev only)
```

### Keep Core Services
```yaml
services:
  mongodb:    # Required
  redis:      # Required (BullMQ notifications)
  backend:    # Your Express API
  frontend:   # Your React app
```

---

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Demo Phase**: Use Railway for quick sharing and feedback
2. **Production Phase**: Migrate to Coolify when ready to scale
3. **Backup Plan**: Both support identical docker-compose setup, easy migration

This approach gives you fast demo deployment now and production-ready hosting later without changing your application architecture.
