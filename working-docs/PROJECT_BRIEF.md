## Deliverables
1. GitHub repository with README  
2. Working application (Docker setup preferred)  
3. API documentation  
4. Short demo video (5-10 min) explaining your implementation  
5. Brief technical document (1-2 pages) covering:  
   a. Key design decisions  
   b. Challenges and solutions  
   c. Future scaling considerations

## Bonus Features (Optional)
- CSV import/export  
- Budget alerts

## Time Expectation
This is designed as a weekend project (~16â€“20 hours). Focus on core functionality and code quality over feature completeness.

## Additional Notes
- Use of AI coding assistants is allowed but must be disclosed:  
  - Which AI tools you used  
  - What you used them for (e.g., "boilerplate generation", "debugging", "schema design")  
  - What you built/modified yourself  

- External libraries are encouraged (explain why you chose them)  
- Focus on demonstrating understanding over feature completeness  
- Production-ready code is not expected, but production considerations should be discussed
