# Claude AI Instructions

## Source of Truth: AGENTS.md
**Read AGENTS.md first** - it contains the complete project context, deliverable requirements, and documentation structure. This file only adds Claude-specific reminders.

## Core Requirement: Auto-Documentation
**Every time you help with implementation, MUST append to documentation files.**

### When You Write Code → README_NOTES.md
- Working commands
- Environment setup steps
- Troubleshooting solutions

### When You Make Design Decisions → TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md  
- Context + Decision + Reasoning + Alternatives + Trade-offs
- Include time estimates

### When You Implement Features → DEMO_SCRIPT_NOTES.md
- Technical highlights worth demonstrating
- UX improvements
- Cool engineering aspects

## Documentation Files (from AGENTS.md)
- `README_NOTES.md` - Setup instructions
- `TECHNICAL_DECISIONS.md` - Design decisions log
- `DEMO_SCRIPT_NOTES.md` - Demo talking points
- `API_EXAMPLES.md` - Working API examples

## Format Example
```markdown
## Feature Name (Date + Time Estimate)
**Context**: Problem being solved
**Decision**: What you chose  
**Reasoning**: Why this approach
**Demo Value**: What makes this impressive
```

**Remember**: Goal is impressive interview project. Always contribute to that through proper documentation.
