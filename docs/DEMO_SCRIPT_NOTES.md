# Demo Script Notes

## Edge Case Date Handling (Technical Highlight)
**Demo Talking Point**: "Industry-standard billing date calculations following Stripe's approach"
**Show**: 
- Create subscription on Jan 31st with monthly billing
- Demonstrate how it correctly renews Feb 28th (or 29th in leap year), then Mar 31st
- Mention this follows the same logic as Stripe and other major payment processors
**Technical Depth**: 
- Custom date calculation algorithms
- Leap year handling
- Strategy pattern for different business rules
**Why It Impresses**: Shows attention to production-ready edge cases most developers overlook

## Type Safety Implementation
**Demo Talking Point**: "Comprehensive TypeScript types prevent runtime errors"
**Show**: Shared types between frontend/backend, validation constants, type guards
**Code Location**: `shared/types/subscription.ts`
**Technical Depth**: Money stored in minor units, denormalized analytics fields
**Why It Impresses**: Shows scalable architecture thinking and data consistency planning
